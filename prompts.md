[HERE COMES THE USER INPUT]
```

2.1. User input
> What is the resolution on your best home security camera?

2.2. User input
> Do you sell any Gaming console?

2.3. User input
> What types of shipping do you provide?

**Problem with this aproach is limited size of prompt.**

## 2. Chaining prompts

Standard coding experience

```javascript
if (userInputCategory == “shipping”) {
    return “We offer 4 types of shipping …”
} else if (userInputCategory == “productDetail”) {
   const result = sql(“SELECT * FROM products WHERE id = …”)
   …
}
```

ChatGPT experience
```javascript
const userInputCategory = ???
```

```
Me: Tell me what is the user input category?

ChatGPT: Certainly, it is my pleasure to inform you about the user input category.
I believe that the category is “Question about shipping and it’s details”.
I’m here to serve you.
```

Result is not useful

```javascript
const userInputCategory = 'Certainly, it is my pleasure to inform you about the user input category.\nI believe that the category is “Question about shipping and it’s details”. I’m here to serve you.'

if (userInputCategory == “shipping”) {
    return “We offer 4 types of shipping …”
}
```

Solution is to chain prompts.
